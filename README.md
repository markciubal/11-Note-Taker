## Description
Scribe is a note taking applicaiton built on Express. The purpose of this application was to demonstrate routing in order to load, save, and delete notes. By utilizing the fetch API with different methods, we are able to perform the correct function on notes within the application.

This application was meant to satisfy the following user story:

```md 
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
✅ THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
✅ THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
✅ THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
✅ THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
✅ THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
✅ THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
BONUS:
When I click the delete button for each note
✅ THEN the appropriate note is deleted
```
